## **𝙷𝚒, 𝙸'𝚖 𝙹𝚒𝚝𝚝𝚎𝚛𝚋𝚢𝚝𝚎𝚜**

I love tinkering with boards and writing firmware for them.
This is my **𝚍𝚞𝚖𝚙𝚢𝚊𝚛𝚍 𝚘𝚏 𝚙𝚛𝚘𝚓𝚎𝚌𝚝𝚜** -- or will be.

You're probably here for the code. If you find what ya needed, cheers 🍻.. If not, keep exploring 🚀.

Most of this is just my useless tinkering (things I built for fun),
but maybe it'll help ya or spark na idea or teach ya something.

I don’t know how long I’ll keep uploading (I’m ambitiously lazy 😅),  
but I hope to stick with it long enough to see the change in myself.  

So… **𝚆𝚎𝚕𝚌𝚘𝚖𝚎!** 🚀
