👋 Hi, I’m Jitterbytes 

I love tinkering with boards and writing firmware for them.  
This is my **dumpyard of projects** — or will be.  

👉 You’re probably here for the code.  
If you find what ya needed, **cheers 🍻**.  
If not, keep exploring **🚀**.  

Most of this is just my *“useless tinkering”* (things I built for fun),  
but maybe it’ll help ya, spark an idea, or even teach ya something.  

I don’t know how long I’ll keep uploading (**I’m ambitiously lazy 😅**),  
but I hope to stick with it long enough to see the change in myself.  

So… **Welcome!** 🚀
