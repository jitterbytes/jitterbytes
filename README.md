## **𝙷𝚒, 𝙸'𝚖 𝙹𝚒𝚝𝚝𝚎𝚛𝚋𝚢𝚝𝚎𝚜**

I tinker with boards and write firmware on them try out stuffs.
This is my **journal** -- or will be.

Very surprising that you are reading this. If you find what ya needed, cheers 🍻.. If not, keep exploring 🚀.

Most of this is just my _useless tinkering to gain knowledge_, but maybe it'll help ya or spark na idea or teach ya something.

I don’t know how long I’ll keep uploading (I’m ambitiously lazy 😅),  
but I hope to stick with it long enough to see the change in myself.  

So… **𝚆𝚎𝚕𝚌𝚘𝚖𝚎!!** 🚀
